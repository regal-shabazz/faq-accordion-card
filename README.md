# Frontend Mentor - FAQ accordion card

![Design preview for the FAQ accordion card coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this FAQ accordion card and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- **Bonus**: Complete the challenge without using JavaScript

## Where to find everything

The task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.




Feel free to contribute.

**Thanks For Viewing!** ðŸš€
